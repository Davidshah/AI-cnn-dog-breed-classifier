# Dog Breed Classifier with Convolutional Neural Network

### Overview

In this project, we will learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

### Getting Started

Download training data:
* [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`.
* [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.
* [resnet50 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogResnet50Data.npz). Place in repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.

Obtain the necessary Python packages from `requirements.txt`.

Run `jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb`.
